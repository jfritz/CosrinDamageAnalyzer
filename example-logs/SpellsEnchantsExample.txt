At the inner sand garden of the Monks Guild roof gardens
A shallow circular pit is inset slightly into the guild roof, which forms a
perimeter for this large sand garden. Two massive stones are sunk into the
ivory white sand here and give you a sense of stability. Lines drawn in the
sand glow and fade; with the same ephemeral spirit of the nearby flowers.
